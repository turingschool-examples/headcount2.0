# HeadCount 2.0


### Project Description

### Team
Team members for this project included Alexander Ela.

### Functionality
* To use HeadCount, users need only to enter a search query to filter through all 181 school districts contained in the site's dataset.
* At any point, users can select up to two cards. Once two cards have been selected, they will be displayed at the top of the page with a comparison summary of each school district's averages, and the compared value between them.
