# HeadCount 2.0

HeadCount 2.0 is a project designed to challenge your skills at manipulating data and creating small, reusable React components.  

You will start the project by importing files containing various educational stats from districts within Colorado by year, per district.  

In the spirit of TDD we have created some unit tests for you to start off with. These tests will help you break out calculation logic into a `DistrictRepository` class. After you finish `iteration 1` you'll move on to creating the rest of the react application on your own, with the expectation that you will continue to test the application on your own.

This application was built using the `create-react-app` boilerplate. This boilerplate provides a lot of build in content and dependencies for free. Take a few minutes to read through [the documentation](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), and remember to refer back to these docs if you run into unexpected issues.  

## Project Goals

* Separate application logic into small, testable functions.
* Create modular, reusable React components.
* Use propTypes to validate props passed to each component.
* Write meaningful, comprehensive unit and integration tests.

## Project Requirements

This project is broken out into multiple iterations. You are expected to complete all required iterations for a passing score, additional extensions are provided to push your comfort level.  

#### More Data Files  
* Right now we are only loading the `kindergartners_in_full_day_program.js` file. Create a header with buttons that dynamically load each of the different files provided in this repo.  
* The UI should change to reflect the data provided by the file selected.  
* The buttons should be modular React components.  

#### Individual District Data Analysis
* When a district is selected it should display the average of its data anywhere it is displayed.  

## Specification Adherence

- 4 - The application completes all 5 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.
- 3 - The application completes all 5 iterations.
- 2 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 of the features outlined in the specification above.
- 1 - The application is missing multiple features essential to having a complete application.

### Code Quality

- 4 - Developer demonstrates complete understanding of React with appropriately separated components and exceptionally well refactored code.
- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.
- 2 - Developer selected appropriate libraries and frameworks to build the app but did not use them as intended. Significant refactoring necessary.
- 1 - Developer did not make any effort to use React effectively or refactor code.

### CSS/Design

- 4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)
- 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)
- 2 - Developer has made intentional design decisions to create a user friendly application but Louisa would be mad. Attempts to follow [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)
- 1 - Developer did minimal to no CSS for this project besides what was indicated in the comp.

### Testing

- 4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested
- 3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing
- 2 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested
- 1 - There was little to no attempt to test this application.

### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.
- Fail - There are components missing proptype validation.

### README Updates
- Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and
  running
- Fail - The boilerplate README is still in place

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint showsâ€¦

* 4 - Zero complaints
* 3 - Five or fewer complaints
* 2 - Six to ten complaints
* 1 - More than ten complaints

### Workflow
- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.

- 3 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.

- 2 - Developer(s) make large, inconsistent commits that contain irrelevant changesets and make it difficult to follow the evolution of the application. Developer(s) rarely use git branches and frequently incorporate changes directly into master with little or no review process. There are instances of committed source code that should be .gitignored and instances of dead code and/or debugger statements.

- 1 - Developer(s) make very few commits that each cover too much responsibility and aren't indicative of how the application evolved. Branches and pull requests were not used and changesets were applied directly to master. There are many instances of committed source code that should be .gitignored and many instances of dead code and/or debugger statements.
