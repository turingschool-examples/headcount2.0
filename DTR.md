# DTR: Define the Relationship

Use this template to when conducting DTR with your project partners. It's recommended that you copy/paste this template into your own gist each time you conduct a DTR to take notes on the conversation. 

### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

* What are your learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?
##### Goals
- Become comfortable with prop types
- Utilize complex data sets in React
- Build a strong UX for the data
- Create strong test suite
- Make comments on PRs on GitHub
##### Drives
- Learn as much as possible about React and Data - Data is the heart of web apps right now

* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
- Mixed, have used both styles before in the past
- Planning to pair code or code adjacent to each other - working in the same space, possibly on different issues

* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
- When possible, communicate face to face
- Written communication is fine, but prefer face to face (Should be easy since we have the same classes)

* How would you describe your work style?
- Rufus: Pseudocode then lots of thinking followed by rapid coding and testing
- Hector: Dive right in to coding, seek help as needed, code until successful

We're planning to pseudocode together, create issues/tickets, play to differing strengths - Hector prefers coding immediately, Rufus takes time to think (sometimes too much time), working together will give the benefits of planning and starting immediately.

* What are your strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
- Rufus: Strategic, Learner
- Hector: Adaptive, Empathetic


* Whatâ€™s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
- React testing went poorly - Not enough time spent learning how tests in react work
- eslint configuration
- Usage of Waffle/GitHub issue tracking

* How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
- Discuss possible options for direction
- Discuss potential strengths/issues of each option
- Agree on best direction, even if it is working on different things

* How will we overcome obstacles?
- Seek help from others when coding problems arise (cohort members, mod 4 students)
- Maintain open and honest communication

* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
- Quiet area to code (physically and aurally)
- At least 1 extra screen

* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
##### Requirements
- Need to know in advance if working through dinner
- Latest @ Turing is 7pm
- Earliest @ Turing is 7am
- Rufus: Need part of Saturday or Sunday to play Disc Golf
- Earliest on the weekend: 12pm

##### Preferences
- Before class (7:30) and After class
- weekends work the afternoon

* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
- Appreciative primarily
- generally no - some difficulties arise if feedback seems ineffective to resolving issue

* What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
- Hector: Strong with CSS and React Basics - Struggles with testing 
- Rufus: Strong with Data and JS - Struggles with CSS and testing

Plan to take some tickets that play to our weaknesses so our teammate can assist and worst case scenario project goals can be met by trading tickets

* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
waffle for issue tracking

* How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
- Reach out for assistance, take good notes/explain to coding pair if done solo
- maintain communication about issues

* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
- Good Scores
- Application is easy to use and displays data effectively
- Application has a solid testing suite that uses Enzyme well
- Project Learning goals are met

* How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?
- Good tests are a cause for celebrations
